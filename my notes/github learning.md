Context: You’re using the GitHub extension in VS Code and trying to make a commit.
Message:
> "There are no staged changes to commit.
Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?"

What does this mean?
Staged changes are files you’ve marked as ready to be committed (using git add or the "+" button in VS Code).
Unstaged changes are files you’ve modified, but haven’t yet marked as ready for commit.
In your case:
You have modified g_z.py, but you haven’t staged it yet.
You tried to commit, but Git requires you to stage changes first.
VS Code is asking:
“Should I automatically stage all your changes and then commit them for you?”
The options:
Yes: Stages all your current changes and commits them.
Always: Always do this automatically in the future.
Never: Never do this automatically; you’ll have to stage manually.
Cancel: Cancel the commit process.
In summary:
You need to stage your changes before committing. This dialog is offering to do that for you.
