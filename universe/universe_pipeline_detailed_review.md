# Excel-to-Parquet Data Pipeline: Detailed Review

---

## 1. Project Structure and Modularity

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Core logic in `src/pipeline/universe_processor.py` (processing, validation, reporting).
  - Configuration in `config/config.yaml` (columns, buckets, etc.).
  - Logging via `LogManager` to `logs/`.
  - Data validation/reporting via `DataValidator` and `DataReporter`.
- **Directory Layout:**
  - **Raw Data:** `universe/raw data/` (source Excel files).
  - **Processed Data:** `universe/universe.parquet` (output).
  - **Logs:** `logs/` (pipeline logs).
  - **Config:** `config/config.yaml` (settings).
  - **State Tracking:** `universe/processing_state.json` (incremental state).

---

## 2. Incremental Processing Logic

- **State Management:**
  - Uses `processing_state.json` to track last processed timestamp/hash for each Excel file.
  - On each run, compares current files to state, identifies new/changed files.
  - Only new/modified files are processed and appended to Parquet.
- **File Hashing:**
  - Hashes file content (e.g., SHA256) for robust change detection.

---

## 3. Excel File Processing

- **Header Handling:**
  - Reads Excel files with headers on the second row; promotes first data row to headers.
- **Date Extraction:**
  - Extracts date from filename and adds as a column.
- **Column Selection:**
  - Keeps only columns specified in config.
- **Bucketed Columns:**
  - Adds "Yrs Since Issue Bucket" and "Yrs (Mat) Bucket" using custom bins from config.
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Drops rows with missing CUSIP.
  - Converts all object columns to string before saving to Parquet.

---

## 4. Data Validation and Quality Checks

- **DataValidator:**
  - Checks for nulls in critical columns, duplicate CUSIPs, out-of-range values, unexpected/missing columns.
  - Logs validation errors in detail.
- **DataReporter:**
  - Reports null analysis, descriptive stats, value counts, and DataFrame snapshot.

---

## 5. Logging and Audit Trail

- **LogManager:**
  - Logs all steps, warnings, errors, and validation results to timestamped files in `logs/`.
  - INFO, WARNING, and ERROR levels for clear audit trail.

---

## 6. Configuration Management

- **config/config.yaml:**
  - Stores columns to keep, bucket definitions, and other parameters.
  - Enables updates without code changes.

---

## 7. Usability and Automation

- **Easy Execution:**
  - Run from terminal or batch file.
  - Poetry for dependency management.
  - VS Code settings for default interpreter.
- **Documentation:**
  - Workflow and troubleshooting in `README.md` and inline comments.

---

## 8. Version Control and Collaboration

- **Git Integration:**
  - All changes tracked in Git and pushed to GitHub.

---

## 9. Professional Best Practices

- **Error Handling:**
  - try/except blocks for robust error capture and logging.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Modular design for easy addition of new sources, rules, or outputs.
- **Performance:**
  - Incremental processing and efficient I/O for scalability.
- **Data Integrity:**
  - Validation and reporting ensure high data quality.

## 10. Example Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. User adds new Excel files to `universe/raw data/`.
2. User runs the pipeline.
3. Pipeline loads `processing_state.json` and identifies new/changed files.
4. For each new/changed file:
    - Reads Excel, promotes correct header row.
    - Extracts date from filename.
    - Selects/renames columns as per config.
    - Adds bucketed columns.
    - Drops rows with missing CUSIP.
    - Validates and reports on data.
5. Appends cleaned data to `universe.parquet`.
6. Updates `processing_state.json`.
7. Writes detailed logs and reports to `logs/`.
8. User reviews logs and reports for data quality and status.
