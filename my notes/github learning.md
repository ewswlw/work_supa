Context: You’re using the GitHub extension in VS Code and trying to make a commit.
Message:
> "There are no staged changes to commit.
Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?"

What does this mean?
Staged changes are files you’ve marked as ready to be committed (using git add or the "+" button in VS Code).
Unstaged changes are files you’ve modified, but haven’t yet marked as ready for commit.
In your case:
You have modified g_z.py, but you haven’t staged it yet.
You tried to commit, but Git requires you to stage changes first.
VS Code is asking:
“Should I automatically stage all your changes and then commit them for you?”
The options:
Yes: Stages all your current changes and commits them.
Always: Always do this automatically in the future.
Never: Never do this automatically; you’ll have to stage manually.
Cancel: Cancel the commit process.
In summary:
You need to stage your changes before committing. This dialog is offering to do that for you.

What is a Pull Request (PR)?
A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes you’ve made in your branch to be merged into another branch (usually the main branch, like master or main) in a GitHub repository. It’s a core part of collaborative development on GitHub.
In Your Project (and with the Extension):
1. Your Workflow
You make changes in your project (often in a new branch, not master).
You commit those changes.
You want to share those changes with others, get feedback, or merge them into the main codebase.
2. What Creating a PR Does
Proposes your changes: It tells others, “Here are my changes, can we review and possibly merge them?”
Starts a review process: Others can comment, request changes, or approve.
Tracks discussion: All feedback, approvals, and status checks are tracked in one place.
Merges code: Once approved, your changes can be merged into the target branch.
3. With the VS Code Extension
The extension lets you create, view, and manage pull requests directly from VS Code, without going to the GitHub website.
You can:
See a list of open PRs.
Create a new PR from your current branch.
Review code, leave comments, and approve or request changes.
See status checks and merge PRs (if you have permission).
Analogy
Think of a pull request as submitting a “change proposal” to a team project:
You finish your part (in your own copy/branch).
You submit your work for review (the PR).
The team reviews, discusses, and, if all is good, merges your work into the main project.
In Your Project
If you’re working alone, PRs are still useful for tracking changes, code review (even self-review), and keeping a clean history.
If you’re collaborating, PRs are essential for code review, discussion, and quality control.

When Should You Start a New Pull Request (PR)?
Best Practice:
Start a new PR for each distinct feature, bugfix, or task.
This keeps your changes focused, reviewable, and easy to track.
When to Create the PR?
1. At the Start (Before Touching the Codebase)
Create a new branch for your feature before you start coding.
But: You don’t need to open a PR immediately.
(Some teams do this for visibility, but it’s not required.)
2. After You’ve Made and Committed Changes
Recommended:
Make your changes in your feature branch.
Commit your work.
When you’re ready for feedback, review, or merging, then open a PR.
Why Not Open a PR Before Coding?
A PR is a proposal to merge changes. If you haven’t made any changes yet, there’s nothing to review or discuss.
However, if you want early feedback or to discuss your approach, you can open a “draft PR” with a description of your plan.
Summary Table
Step	What to Do
New feature/bug/task	Create a new branch
Start coding	Work in your branch, commit as you go
Ready for review/merge	Open a PR from your branch to main/master
Want early feedback	Optionally open a draft PR before finishing
Pro Tips
One PR per feature/fix: Keeps code review focused and history clean.
Draft PRs: Useful if you want to share work-in-progress for early feedback.
Don’t work directly on master/main: Always use a feature branch.
Analogy:
Think of a PR as submitting a finished (or nearly finished) assignment for review. You don’t submit an empty assignment—you submit it when you have something to show!

# Starting a New Feature (e.g., Front End) with Git, GitHub, and VS Code Pull Requests Extension

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Make Sure Your Local `master` (or `main`) is Up to Date

```sh
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```
*Ensures you’re starting from the latest code.*

---

### 2. Create a New Feature Branch

```sh
git checkout -b feature/frontend
```
*Name the branch to describe your feature, e.g., `feature/frontend`.*

---

### 3. Start Building Your Front End

- Make your changes, add new files, etc.
- Save and test as you go.

---

### 4. Stage and Commit Your Changes

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Start building front end: initial setup"
```
*Make small, focused commits as you progress.*

---

### 5. Push Your Branch to GitHub

```sh
git push -u origin feature/frontend
```

---

### 6. Open a Pull Request (PR) Using the Extension

- In VS Code, go to the GitHub Pull Requests view (GitHub icon).
- Click “Create Pull Request” for your new branch.
- Fill in the PR title and description (explain what you’re building).
- Optionally, mark it as a “Draft” if not ready for review.

---

### 7. Continue Working

- As you make more changes, commit and push them to the same branch.
- The PR will update automatically with your new commits.

---

### 8. When Ready, Mark PR as Ready for Review

- When your front end is ready for feedback or merging, mark the PR as “Ready for review.”
- Reviewers (or you, if solo) can review, discuss, and eventually merge the PR.

## Why My Local Project Wasn't Syncing with GitHub

### **Root Cause**

- **Uncommitted Local Changes:**  
  You had local changes (e.g., in `my notes/github learning.md`) that were not staged and committed.
- **Push Only Sends Committed Changes:**  
  When you ran `git push`, only committed changes are sent to GitHub. Uncommitted changes remain local and do not appear on GitHub.
- **Command Chaining Issue:**  
  Previous attempts to run multiple git commands in one line (`&&`) failed in PowerShell, so the full sequence (add, commit, push) did not complete as intended.

---

### **How It Was Fixed**

1. **Staged all outstanding changes:**  
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
2. **Committed them with a clear message:**  
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Sync outstanding changes"
   ```
3. **Pushed the commit to the remote `master` branch:**  
   ```sh
   git push origin master
   ```

---

### **Summary Table**

| Step                | Status Before Fix | Status After Fix      |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Local changes       | Not committed    | Committed             |
| Pushed to GitHub    | Not up to date   | Fully synchronized    |
| Command chaining    | Failed in shell  | Run as separate steps |
